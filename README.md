# Atliq-Mart-Sales-analysis

AtliQ mart is a chain of supermarkets in India. Recently they have implemented a promotional campaign during the festival time in India. The Sales director of AtliQ mart wants to know the company's performance after implementing those promotional campaigns. He also has specific business requests that needs to be answered related to this promotions undertaken by the company. 

Here, in this project I have queried down the business requests from the sales director in MySQL and created a Power BI sales dashboard to analyze the performance of the company after the implementation of the promotion schemes.
